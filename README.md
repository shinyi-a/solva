# ☀︎SOLVA - A project management dashboard for SolarNova Project
## Preface

This dashboard is designed for projects with multiple small project sites, and based on the use case for the SolarNova project. It is able to track the different milestones, upload/download documents and at a glance know which project sites to prioritise.
There are 3 different user roles and views for the dashboard – Admin, Project Manager and Auditor. The user matrix will be as follows:
