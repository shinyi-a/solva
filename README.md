# ☀︎SOLVA - A project management dashboard for SolarNova Project
## Preface
The inspiration behind this project was from my time as a project engineer working on the [SolarNova](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/about-us/our-role/smart-and-sustainable-living/solarnova-page) project. For the unfamiliar, SolarNova is a HDB initiate that rents out Singapore’s HDB rooftop spaces to companies for them to build and maintain solar photovoltaic systems on. With each HDB block being a standalone system, the SolarNova project consists of many project sites where a project engineer will be in charge of multiple sites at any one time. This made it really messy and challenging to manage with just an Excel sheet, SharePoint and sheer memory work. This project management dashboard was what I wish I had during my time working as project engineer on this project.
